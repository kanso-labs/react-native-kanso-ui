# react-native-kanso-ui

Kanso UI's Material Design components for React Native, built on the same design
tokens and theming as
[`@kanso-labs/kanso-ui`](https://github.com/kanso-labs/kanso-ui).

A theme is the web library's: a set of `--kui-*` custom properties with values
in CSS syntax, as kanso-ui's `tokens.css` declares them, so one theme object
serves a web app and a native app alike.

The package has not been released yet.

## Development

Install with the Node version in `.tool-versions`:

```bash
mise exec node@"$(awk '/^nodejs/{print $2}' .tool-versions)" -- npm install
